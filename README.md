This repo just holds my CV written in LaTeX. It's written both in Spanish and English and automatically published using GitHub actions:

- ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ [Spanish Version](https://daviddavo.github.io/22CV/David_Davo_CV_Spanish.pdf)

You can find a blog post about it [here](https://blog.ddavo.me/en/posts/tutorials/automatic-latex-cv/).
